Introduction

Simple tray application

Running and installing
======================

To run the applet, simply launch ghost.py: ./ghost.py.

You can also install it globably on your system using the provided install
script. The command to launch is then "ghost" (without the .py).

If you like it, I would suggest adding it to the startup applications of your desktop
environment.
